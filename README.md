# KillThemAll_Thalkiel
Skull of the Man'ari module for KillThemAll

This module will add Skull of the Man'ari to the KillThemAll addon.

Once installed, you'll be able to add it to your "gods" list just as any other god.

To refer to it in the slash commands, use "thalkiel". For example, to add it to your gods list, type "/kta AddGod thalkiel".
 

This is an optional module! You need the original KillThemAll addon in order for this one to work!
